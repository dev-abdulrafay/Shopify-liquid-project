Shopify Product Detail Page (PDP) Challenge

Implementation Overview

For this challenge, I created a basic Product Detail Page using Shopify Liquid and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a summary of my approach:

1. Liquid Template Structure: I used a clean HTML layout in the Liquid template to display product details like title, price, variant options, and description.

2. Variant Selection: I chose buttons for selecting product variants instead of a dropdown. This makes it easier to use on mobile devices and allows for more styling flexibility.

3. Dynamic Price Updates: I used JavaScript to update the price dynamically when a variant is selected, so users see immediate changes.

4. Add to Cart Functionality: I added an AJAX feature to add products to the cart and show a success message without refreshing the page.

5. Collapsible Description: I made the product description collapsible to keep the page neat and let users expand it for more details.

Favorite Aspect:
I enjoyed implementing the dynamic variant selection and price updates. Combining Liquid for initial content and JavaScript for interactive updates was a rewarding challenge.

Changes for a Real Shopify Theme

For an actual Shopify theme, I would:

1. Theme Settings: Allow merchants to customize colors, fonts, and layout through settings without code changes.

2. Modular Sections: Make the PDP modular so sections can be easily rearranged or removed in the theme customizer.

3. Performance Optimization: Use lazy loading for images and optimize asset loading to speed up the page.

4. Accessibility: Ensure the theme is accessible to all users by conducting an accessibility audit.

5. App Integration: Ensure compatibility with popular Shopify apps for reviews, wishlists, etc.

6. Cross-Browser Testing: Test across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent performance.

This challenge was a great way to showcase Shopify development skills while focusing on functionality and user experience.
